Pi Sprinklers
==============

This is a small personal project to run a sprinkler system on a Raspberry Pi (or any server).  It uses the Symfony framework for the console, MySQL for the data, and a cron job to check the database.  Eventually, it will have a GUI interface to be able to view/modify settings.
